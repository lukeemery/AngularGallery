# AngularGallery

Requirements:

Create an image gallery application that allows a user to view a set of images. Requirements:

- The user can click an image and that image will be brought into focus larger.
- Each image will have a set of user comments.
- The user can leave as many comments on each image as they like. This is similiar to something like Disqus comments.
- After a user submits a new comment, save it to the server (This doesn't need a backend. Just make an AJAX call to a dummy URL).
- The comments must persist when a user selects a new image.
- Any modern JS tooling or library can be used (Build tools, libraries, utilities...).
- AngularJS is a requirement.
- The app should be useable from a style stand point, but CSS is less important than the application code.

What we are looking for:

- Application structure (Use of services, controllers, etc...)
- JavaScript best practices
- Use of tools and tool choices
